# Machine-Learning

This course provides an introduction on machine learning. It gives an overview of many concepts, techniques and algorithms in machine learning, beginning with topics such as classification and linear regression and ending up with more recent topics such support vector machines. The course is divided into three main topics: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and machine learning theory. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (linear decision, non linear decision and probabilistic). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, factor analysis, visualization). (iii) Learning theory (bias/variance theory, empirical risk minimization). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to computer vision, medical informatics, and signal analysis.
